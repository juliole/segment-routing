excerpt: >-
  An introduction to the Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SRTE) technology.
  See how SRTE provides a simple, automated, and scalable architecture to
  engineer traffic flows in a network. Further, see how XR Traffic Controller
  (XTC) (the IOS XR based Path Computation Element (PCE)) fits into this
  architecture.

An introduction to the Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SRTE) technology. See how SRTE provides a simple, automated, and scalable architecture to engineer traffic flows in a network. Further, see how XR Traffic Controller (XTC) (the IOS XR based Path Computation Element (PCE)) fits into this architecture. XTC provides scalable multi-domain SR-optimized path computation capabilities, including multi-domain path disjointness.
SRTE provides lots of functionality. It was designed with lead operators, along their use-cases.
